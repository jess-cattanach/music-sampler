<h1>Welcome to The Neighbourhood</h1>

<p>The Neighbourhood is an alternative rock band consisting of four members: Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Mikey Margott, and Zach Abels. Brandon Fried was a drummer in the band from 2014 to 2022. Formed in 2011 in California, the group has amassed millions of listeners. Their album "I Love You" contained the song "Sweater Weather" which became extremely popular, pushing them into the spotlight.</p>

<p>Since then, they have released multiple albums, each one with songs that became viral and relatively recognizable. The universally appealing topics in their lyrics (friendship, love, insecurity, doubt) combined with captivating backtracks make their music extremely enjoyable.</p>

<p>The band has performed at Coachella, appeared on late night shows, earned over a billion streams, and worked with many artists including Lana Del Ray and Denzel Curry.</p>
